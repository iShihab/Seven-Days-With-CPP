OOP-> Object-Oriented Programming
The opposite of OOP is procedural Programming e.g. C(Programming language)

4 PILLARS of OOP
1. Encapsulation------> Reduce complexity,increase reusability
2. Abstraction-------> Reduce complexity,isolate impact of change 
3. Inheritance-------> eliminate redundant code
4. Polymorphism-------> refactor ugly switch case statemnet
